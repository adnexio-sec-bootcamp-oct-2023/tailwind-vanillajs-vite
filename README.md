# Responsive Sidebar Project

This project demonstrates a responsive sidebar navigation with a toggle feature and a grid layout for content cards. It uses Tailwind CSS for styling and is configured to work with Vite for an efficient development workflow.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running this project, you need to have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine. You can download them from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project-name.git your-project-name```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```cd your-project-name```

3. Install the project dependencies:
```npm install```

4. Start development server
To start the development server, run the following command:
```npm run dev```

This will start the local server, usually on http://localhost:3000, and you can view the application in your web browser.

####Building for Production
To build the project for production, use the following command:
```npm run build```
This will generate a dist directory with your minified assets, ready to be deployed to a production server.

#####Previewing the Build
If you want to preview the production build on your local machine, you can use Vite's preview feature:
```npm run preview```
This will serve the content of the dist directory on a local static server, allowing you to inspect the production build before deployment.
